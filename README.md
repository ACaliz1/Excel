# Excel


This project is a web-based spreadsheet application that emulates basic functionality of Microsoft Excel. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for creating and editing spreadsheets directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Spreadsheet Interface**: A grid-based interface that allows users to enter and edit data in cells.
- **Multiple Rows and Columns**: Supports a configurable number of rows and columns.
- **Data Entry**: Allows text and numeric data entry in each cell.
- **Basic Styling**: CSS for a clean and simple design that mimics the look and feel of a spreadsheet.
- **Interactive Elements**: Cells are interactive, with input fields to enter data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, making it look like a spreadsheet application.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the interactivity, such as data entry, table generation, and dynamic updates.
